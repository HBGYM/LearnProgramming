# Git 

## What is Git?
It is defined as source control management (SCM) and/or as version control software (VCS) depending on who you ask
It is THE most commonly used tool amongst software developers by a far margin

Linus Torvalds, creater of the "Linux"-kernel, needed a way to optimize code sharing between developers, and so Git was created.
Git allows for everyone to work together on a shared code base, divide and conquer!

If you've setup a local repository, there will be a .git folder (sometimes hidden)
It keeps track of file changes in the underlaying folders which can be "committed" and "pushed" to an online repository
It can also help keep tracks of other peoples changes and allows for merging between folders/directories/files.


## Gitkraken
Git is originally a Command Line Interface (CLI) with many complex functionalities.
GitKraken hides a lot of the complexity via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and eases the learning curve considerably.

We will use it every lesson to keep track of scripts created and modified alongside any notes taken during class.
This will also be used to upload deliverable assignments.
