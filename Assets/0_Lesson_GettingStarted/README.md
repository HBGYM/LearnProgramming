# Git and source control management

## What is Git?
Invented out of need for collaboration and coordination between software developers
It allows for working on a shared code base in a tree/branch-like structure.

We will use it every lesson to keep track of scripts created and modified alongside any notes taken during class.
This will also be used to upload deliverable assignments.

## Gitkraken
Git is originally a Command Line Interface (CLI) with many complex functionalities.
GitKraken hides a lot of the complexity via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and eases the learning curve considerably.
