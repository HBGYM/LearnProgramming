# Notes

## Lesson 0

### Overall

I've learned a lot, but I'm so confused by the many different applications and concepts I have to learn!

We made use of a 3 different programs to achieve "hello world" printed in a console.... wauw...

I've learned about version control via GitKraken, or rather Git (or Github?), and I've been inspired to use it as much as possible! Opensource rocks!

I found an interesting Github repository with a collection of many old games created in Unity ready for download!!! https://github.com/proyecto26/awesome-unity 


### Git

I used GitKraken to "Clone" this repository on Github

And I learned that a repository is just a bunch of files, mainly source code though, in a folder/directory that keeps track of file changes 
which can be synchronized to a server, in my case, Github.com

Just like Dropbox, Onedrive, ICloud, and the others... But I have to make the "versions" or "commits" which basically means updates but with versions.


I Setup my own "Remote" repository

I created a commit and pushed changes to my repository

* Note to self; pull before I push


### VSCode

I have used VSCode to change the source code of the helloworld program

Maybe I'm gonna install an extension

 * PlantUML, could be good for design



### Unity

I have used Unity to play the lesson_0 scene

I have inspected the gameobjects in the scene

I ran the tests and got ALL the tests to pass! woop woop!

* Note to self; The Unity Test Runner can be accessed via: Window > Test Runner in the top toolbar
