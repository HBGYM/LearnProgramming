# Start here

You will as a student be placed on top of many layers of software developed over the last hundred years
and as such much complexity will be abstracted away via modern languages and frameworks. We will use this to focus on understanding key aspects of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
You will come to use C# as your language to interact with the Unity game engine through assignments that will be delivered on Github via GitKraken.

So what did that all mean? If you follow below guide, you will come to know, I promise!

# Installation of required tools

## Unity
The Unity engine is a game and animation platform, we will use this tool to get insight into how modern software is developed.

 * Required minimum version 2021.3.1f1
 * HomePage
 * [INSTALL-GIF]

## Git, Github and Gitkraken

 * Gitkraken required minimum version xxx
 * HomePage
 * [INSTALL-GIF]

## VSCode 

 * Required minimum version xxx
 * HomePage
 * [INSTALL-GIF]


# Assignments

 * Go through all Scenes in the different lesssons folders
 * Fix all broken tests 
 * Push fixes to your own github repository

# Lessons

All lessons will have a corresponding subdirectory under the "Assets" folder with individual instructions best read via Github

In the lesson folders there is a "Study" folder with lesson material and examples.

## 0. Getting started & HelloWorld!

In the first lesson we will:

 * Ensure everyone is setup
 * Overview of Git, Github and Gitkraken 
 * Overview of Unity
 * Overview of VSCode
 * Solve the first assignment together
 * Upload solution to own repository

See the [Getting started](Assets/0_Lesson_GettingStarted) chapter for further instructions.

## 1. C#, Variables and built-in types

## 2. Arithmetics, conditions, flow and intro to methods

## 3. List, Array and loops

## 4. OOP, Classes and objects

## 5. OOP continued, methods, scopes and accessors

## 6. Polymorphism; interfaces and inheritance, implementation and extension

## 7. Extending Unitys MonoBehaviour and GameObjects

# Expected learning

Lessons 0 -> 7, have been created to accomodate:

Programmering B, valgfag
Boerne- og Undervisningsministeriet Styrelsen for Undervisning og Kvalitet, juni 2021

The aim is to provide the student with a good foundation for understanding how software works and is developed and allow for the students to continue learning on their own.
