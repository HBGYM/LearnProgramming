#Start here

You will as a student be placed on top of many layers of software developed over the last hundred years 
and as such much complexity will be abstracted away via modern languages and frameworks. We will use this to focus on understanding key aspects of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
You will come to use C# as your language to interact with the Unity game engine through assignments that will be delivered on Github via GitKraken.

The unity engine is an incredibly sophisticated platform for creating computer/mobile/web games and graphics,

The aim is to provide the student with a good foundation for understanding how software works and is developed and allow for the students to continue learning on their own.

##Lessons

All lessons will have a corresponding directory with individual instructions best read via Github

##Assignments

 * If a lesson have an assignment, instructions will be found alongside.
 * All assignments must be pushed to your own github repository
